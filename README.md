# kubernetes-katas
Deliberate exercises for Kubernetes.

Below are some exercises ordered in the way we think it makes sence to introduce
Kubernetes concepts.  There are tree variants of the ingress exercise - one of
them is Google Kubernetes Engine (gke) specific, whereas the two others are
generic and should work on any Kubernetes cluster.

You can find a summary of many of the commands used in the exercises in the
[cheatsheet.md](cheatsheet.md).
